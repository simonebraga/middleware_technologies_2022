# Instructions

Import in a working Node-RED environment the `demo.json` file. Set the absolute path of `settings.txt` in the block "Read settings file" and your personal API key in the block "Get forecast". As a last step, deploy and run the application.

**NOTE: You can use the helper scripts in this folder to run Node-RED.**
